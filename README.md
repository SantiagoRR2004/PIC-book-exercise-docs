# Programming the IoT

## Overview

This is a project for a subject called "Plataforma de Internet de las Cosas" (Internet of Things) that accounted for 40% of the final grade. It had to be handed in twice: the first half was on Friday, the 21st of March of 2025, and earned a grade of 10 out of 10 points. The complete project submission took place on Friday, the 30th of May of 2025, and earned a grade of $9.7\overline{2}$ out of 10 points.

Because the first half was worth less than the complete project (15% vs. 25%), the final grade was $9.8263\overline{8}$ out of 10.

## Project Summary

For this project, we had to follow the instructions given in this [book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/) to create a Constrained Device Application (CDA) and a Gateway Device Application (GDA) that would communicate with each other. The CDA is implemented in Python in [this repository](https://github.com/SantiagoRR2004/PIC-Python) and the GDA is implemented in Java in [this repository](https://github.com/SantiagoRR2004/PIC-Java).
